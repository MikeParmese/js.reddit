Distance Covered
================

A simple little project that attempts to answer a Reddit post.

> If the fastest vehicle produced each year was put on an infinitely straight track when it was produced, and raced at its top speed indefinitely, which car would currently be in the lead?
> -- [EspenSkjeer](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/fbl31h/if_the_fastest_vehicle_produced_each_year_was_put/fj4ynns/)

Distance traveled is calculated based on [LJ-Rubicon](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/fbl31h/if_the_fastest_vehicle_produced_each_year_was_put/fj4ynns/)'s formula, modified to use current time instead of year.
